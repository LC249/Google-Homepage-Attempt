# Google-Homepage-Attempt
I attempted to recreate the google homepage using HTML and CSS as my first web project.

I thought this would be a good starting point for me with only a somewhat basic understanding of both HTML and CSS.
The project went better than I expected honestly, although I know there are a couple of issues with the homepage as it stands, although for a first attempt I am quite happy.

In the future I intend on adding some JS functionality, so that the user can type something into the search bar and have it either google search or use the 'I'm feeling lucky' functionality as found on the actual homepage.
